        <p>
            Not too long ago, there was a time when I aspired to become an architect. My passion lay in building
            technology and technical drawing during my school days because I had a genuine love for design and
            creativity. However, the construction aspect of architecture didn't hold much appeal for me.

            It wasn't until later that I realized my knack for software and my ability to effectively use various
            software tools (although I never truly mastered any of them). My software choices primarily revolved around
            architecture and graphic design, including programs like Blender, AutoCAD, and SketchUp.

            Interestingly, what I didn't foresee was that I would eventually pursue computer science at UWI (University
            of the West Indies). Prior to that, I had never studied IT or computer science in high school or college.
            But once I started learning, I couldn't quench my thirst for knowledge. I yearned to understand everything,
            from design patterns and object-oriented programming to software engineering, algorithm design, UI/UX, and
            mobile development.

            The world of computer science offered an endless realm of possibilities and learning opportunities, which is
            exactly what I had craved back when I contemplated a career in architecture. I can now learn and build to my
            heart's content. This has been my journey into the world of technology. Peace! ‚úåüèø
